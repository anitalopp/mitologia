                <h1 class="tipografia3">All the bad that comes from "Pan": the Greek god that could have given name to the word "pandemic"</h1>
                <p>It was on March 11th when the WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus a "global pandemic": the word had an impact from the beginning. It is true that it sounds like "global disaster," like severe "crisis." It is true that it generates that disturbing sensation that the bad is in the air. But now that we have started to normalize its use -we have no choice, at least until the Government measures begin to bear fruit- it is a good time to analyze where it comes from and what we really mean when we say pandemic. <br> By definition, this feminine noun refers to an epidemic-type disease that can spread in various countries or nations, or that can be massively contagious to all the people in a locality, province, region, or zone. This term comes from the Greek expression πανδημια, which combines "pan" -all-, "demos" -people- and the suffix "-ia", which alludes to the quality. The word "pandemic" appeared in French and Spanish in the second half of the 18th century. In Latin, in the mid-16th century, when Greek doctors centuries after Christ used the adjective "pandemic" to refer to "what affects the entire population".</p></div>

                <p>Many of the symbols synonymous with good luck actually derive from ancient gods who were indeed associated with fortune. In fact, Fortuna was a famous Roman Goddess, but there are many others from different beliefs who are also associated with good luck. Keep reading to discover some of the most prominent or notable ones.</p>
                <br>Dieties associated with good luck <br> There are many gods belonging to different cultures, but in a large majority, there are gods that represent good luck, and as we mentioned earlier, their symbols prevail and are used, even when they are not directly associated with a deity. Below, we share with you some of the most prominent gods from antiquity who were associated with good luck and culture: <br>
                Kubera <br> This god belongs to Hinduism and was considered the treasurer of the gods, as well as the protector of the world. Nowadays, many people still pray to him, and although he is synonymous with wisdom, as well as removing obstacles and facilitating the way, he is also a deity associated with good luck and wealth. <br>
                Zhao Gongming <br> This god belongs to Chinese mythology and like the previous case, is associated with wealth and fortune. His specific association with good luck is because it was often said that he was a being capable of controlling thunder and lightning, so he could protect humans from plagues and any other natural disasters.
                <br> Gefjun <br> This goddess from Norse mythology is synonymous with prosperity and was highly revered in the territories currently occupied by Denmark and Sweden. Among the many legends that exist, it is said that she once had a great confrontation with Loki, but Odin defended her. She is also known for complaining about the negativity that Loki always brings, making it very clear that she is a goddess characterized by her positive attributes.
                <br> Manat <br> Belonging to Arab mythology, Manat was a pre-Islamic goddess, whose name derived from the words death, time, and destiny. However, she was worshiped believing that she could protect and bring good luck to those who prayed to her. Unfortunately, many of the temples where this goddess was worshiped were lost with the appearance of the first Muslims. Gods
                <br> Practically in every ancient religion, there is a god or figure associated with protection, good luck, and fortune in general. And many of their symbols continue to be used today, some are very well known and others not so much, but they still maintain the same meaning.

                <h1 class="tipografia3">Medallion with the Face of Medusa Found, Dating Back Almost 1,800 Years</h1>
                <p>Archaeologists working in the area of Vindolanda in Britain - at some point in history, it was the northern frontier of the Roman Empire - have come across the surprise of a silver medallion featuring the face of the mythological character Medusa. This discovery dates back to the 2nd century A.D., probably during the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian (117-138 A.D.). <br> As experts explain, it was a military decoration known as a phalera, metal discs mainly used to fasten the straps of Roman legionary helmets and Celtic soldiers. The finding of this object is particularly striking due to its material. Although, as mentioned earlier, they were usually made of ferrous material, this one turns out to be made of silver. <br> John Pollini, an expert in Art History and Greek and Roman Archaeology at the University of Southern California, recounted that many of these insignias have not survived to the present day because they were made of precious materials and were regularly melted down. Probably, due to its special value, the decorated individual must have kept it as an amulet deposited in their tomb, which is why it has survived to the present day. <br> The use of the gorgon Medusa in these types of artifacts is due to its meaning of "repelling evil", as according to Greek mythology, this being had a mane formed by snakes and a gaze that turned men into stone. Since this medal was awarded as a decoration for "valor in battle," warriors would wear them on their belts during battles and parades as a distinction and protection. However, this figure was very common in the clothing and armor of the time as it was attributed "magical" protective effects to its bearer.</p>

                <p>She was a woman, a fairy, a mermaid, and many more things. Melusine was a public tale, a kind of shared mirror from Ireland to Armenia in the Middle Ages. <br> Half human, half animal, the representation of women through the hybrid until well past the Middle Ages was a sort of language cave, an equally dual way of attaching patterns, ideas about social reality. If myths and legends embraced uncertainties in the earliest civilizations, the very possibilities of solace were reduced to biblical pages. Women were assigned to Eve, and thus their representations also arose from the same. However, some of those supernatural entities predating Catholicism continued to wander the halls of medieval Catholic Europe. <br> Melusine (also known as Mélusine or Melusina) was a woman, she was a fairy, she was a mermaid, and many more things. Melusine was a public tale, a kind of shared mirror from Ireland to Armenia. With different reflections, the question has always been the same: why did monarchy and nobility decide to associate themselves with a magical figure who, moreover, in none of her versions attends mass?</p>
