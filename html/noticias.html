                <p>It was on March 11th when the WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus a "global pandemic": the word had an impact from the beginning. It is true that it sounds like "global disaster," like severe "crisis." It is true that it generates that disturbing sensation that the bad is in the air. But now that we have started to normalize its use -we have no choice, at least until the Government measures begin to bear fruit- it is a good time to analyze where it comes from and what we really mean when we say pandemic. <br> By definition, this feminine noun refers to an epidemic-type disease that can spread in various countries or nations, or that can be massively contagious to all the people in a locality, province, region, or zone. This term comes from the Greek expression πανδημια, which combines "pan" -all-, "demos" -people- and the suffix "-ia", which alludes to the quality. The word "pandemic" appeared in French and Spanish in the second half of the 18th century. In Latin, in the mid-16th century, when Greek doctors centuries after Christ used the adjective "pandemic" to refer to "what affects the entire population".</p></div>

                Zhao Gongming <br> This god belongs to Chinese mythology and like the previous case, is associated with wealth and fortune. His specific association with good luck is because it was often said that he was a being capable of controlling thunder and lightning, so he could protect humans from plagues and any other natural disasters.
                <br> Gefjun <br> This goddess from Norse mythology is synonymous with prosperity and was highly revered in the territories currently occupied by Denmark and Sweden. Among the many legends that exist, it is said that she once had a great confrontation with Loki, but Odin defended her.

                <br> Manat <br> Belonging to Arab mythology, Manat was a pre-Islamic goddess, whose name derived from the words death, time, and destiny. However, she was worshiped believing that she could protect and bring good luck to those who prayed to her. Unfortunately, many of the temples where this goddess was worshiped were lost with the appearance of the first Muslims. Gods
